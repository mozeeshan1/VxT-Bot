# FxTwitter and ddInstagram discord bot 


A discord bot that converts twitter links to fxtwitter links and instagram links to ddinstagram links. Fxtwitter links provides better embeds than default twitter embeds. DdInstagram links provide better embed than default instagram embeds. No commands required, just add to server and use. It deletes your message and uses webhooks to copy your display name and avatar in a server and sends it with those attached to the webhook (refer to example). You can also remove mentions you don't want the bot to use, translate tweets, toggle link conversion for tweets with different media types and toggle conversion to direct media links through slash commands (check the changelog channel in the support server for more information).
