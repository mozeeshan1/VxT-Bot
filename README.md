# VxT-Bot

## FxTwitter discord bot


A discord bot that converts twitter links to fxtwitter links. Fxtwitter link provides better embeds than default twitter embeds. No commands required, just add to server and use. It deletes your message and uses webhooks to copy your display name and avatar in a server and sends it with those attached to the webhook (refer to example).

You can use this for your projects. 

**You will need a JSON file in your root directory named Config with your bot access token in a "TOKEN" key.**

Example

```
{
    "TOKEN": "token here"
}
```

Discord bot token can be found here : https://discord.com/developers/applications/

Go in the bot subsection of your application and get your token there. Make sure to **save your token in a secure place** in case you want to access it later as it is only shown once.
