You can use the code as you please. **You will need a JSON file named Config with your bot access token in a "TOKEN" key.** Example {"TOKEN": "token here"}


Discord bot token can be found here : https://discord.com/developers/applications/
Go in the bot subsection of your application and get your token there. Make sure to **save your token in a secure place** in case you want to access it later as it is only shown once.
